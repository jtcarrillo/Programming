# C++

## Why C++?

- C++ is a highly portable language which offers zero-cost abstractions
- C++ provides programmers with the ability to write and manage large, expressive, and robust code bases. 

The more developers working on a code base, the larger the code base becomes. We need abstractions such as functions, classes, data structures, layers, and so on in order to manage the complexity of a large-scale code base. But constantly adding abstraction and new levels of indirection comes at a price - efficiency. This is where zero cost abstraction play its role. A lot of abstraction offered by C++ comes at a very low price. At a minimum, C++ offers efficient alternatives at hot spots where performance really is a concern.
