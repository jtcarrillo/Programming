# C++

## Why C++?

- C++ is a highly portable language which offers zero-cost abstractions
- C++ provides programmers with the ability to write and manage large, expressive, and robust code bases. 

The more developers working on a code base, the larger the code base becomes. We need abstractions such as functions, classes, data structures, layers, and so on in order to manage the complexity of a large-scale code base. But constantly adding abstraction and new levels of indirection comes at a price - efficiency. This is where zero cost abstraction play its role. A lot of abstraction offered by C++ comes at a very low price. At a minimum, C++ offers efficient alternatives at hot spots where performance really is a concern. 

## Abstractions
- C++ classes are abstractions of C-structs and regular functions.
- C++ polymorphism is the abstraction of function pointers.
- C++ lambda functions are abstractions of C++ classes. 
- Templates are abstractions of generating C++ code. 

## Programming Pitfalls
- Monstrous source files with thousands of lines
- Member functions with hundreds or thousands of lines of inscrutable code
- Volumes of dead code
- Build times extending into several hours
- High number of defects
- Logic too convulted by quick fixes to be safely managed
- Code duplicated across files, classes, and modules
- Code riddled with long-obsolete coding practices
